* Transparency - Buying / selling / sourcing transactions are public information. Transactions can be audited and trackable down to material costs, assembling, quality control, etc...

* Anonymous Participants - Participants do not need to disclose their identity such as first and last name. Network guaranteed anonymity in confidential and privacy information such as cost of goods sold.

* Delegate trusts to the network and not participants.  Consumers could trust the network to deliver purchased goods. Suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could trust the network to get paid for fulfilling their obligations.

* Realtime Market Price.  Eliminate the need to bargain or haggling between participants. Prices are guaranteed perfect based on network data such as supply cost, manufacturing cost, market demand, and logistic costs.

* No Middlemen Cost.  Participants pay ZERO cost to buy / sell goods on the network.

* Fraudulent Proof - All participants are required to put up collateral in order to participate in any form of transactions (buying, selling, shipping). Associated participants would lose their collateral or account balance should they commit any form of questionable acts.

* Accountability - All participants are accountable for committing their parts of the contract to the fullest.  Network will charge penalty fees should participants fail their commitments.  For example, the network will charge 1% fees to suppliers, if suppliers ship defective parts to a manufacturer.

* Reward innovations - Network provide innovators by rewarding 1% royalty fees for every goods sold on the network for 5 years.

* Reward consumerism -  More buy-sell transactions mean more rewards for network participants. Network Reward Pool reward tokens to participants base on their stakes and account activities.

* Automatic supply chain management for manufacturers, distributors, and factories.  For example, there is no need for manufacturers to source parts. Network automatically notify part suppliers to ship parts to manufacturers.

* Automate e-commerce business processes. Tasks that involve logistic, invoicing, sale receipts, will be handled by the network automatically.
